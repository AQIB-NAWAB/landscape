           JSON Schema is a declarative language that provides a standardized way to describe and validate JSON data. It describes the content, structure, data types, and expected constraints within a JSON document, which helps ensure the consistency and integrity of JSON data in different applications . JSON Schema is important because JSON lacks the ability to communicate additional information, such as the shape of the data, which fields are missing, or what similar data is supposed to look like. This can lead to ambiguity and inconsistencies when working with JSON data, making it difficult to understand and validate. JSON Schema helps address these issues by providing a clear and standardized way to define the structure and constraints of JSON data, making it easier to work with and validate.
